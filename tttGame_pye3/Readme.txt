The program successfully works.

There are one button at statPanel. 
The"New Game" button is for restart a game, which will clear the board, but not clear the statistics.
(This button is not asked to do by professor but I believe that contaning it will make the whole game complete)
There is also four label at statPanel.
one for showing the turn of the game and, when one of players wins, showing the wining situation, like "win for topRow". Also, it can show the "Draw" when the game is draw.
The other three all shows the player statistics, which include player1, player2, and draw.

The gamePanel is mainly for playing games, which consists of 9 labels and those labels will response to mouseclick and show"X" or "O".
Player1 is "X" and player2 is "O".
Also, when one of players wins the game, the gamePanel will change the background color for wining situation. Player1 is Cyan and player2 is Pink.
